## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run RayPDF locally for development or personal use.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for containerized setup)

### üöÄ Quick Start with Docker

You can run RayPDF directly from Docker Hub without cloning the repository:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 bentopdf/bentopdf:latest
```

Open your browser at: http://localhost:3000

This is the fastest way to try RayPDF without setting up a development environment.

### üöÄ Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

For a more robust setup with auto-restart capabilities:

1. **Download the repo and create a `docker-compose.yml` file or use the one given in repo**:

```yaml
services:
  bentopdf:
    image: bentopdf/bentopdf:latest
    container_name: bentopdf
    ports:
      - '3000:80'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. **Start the application**:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### üöÄ Development Setup

#### Option 1: Run with npm

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf.git
   cd bentopdf
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Option 2: Build and Run with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf.git
   cd bentopdf
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

   > **Note:** After making any local changes to the code, rebuild the Docker image using:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
   ```

   This ensures your latest changes are applied inside the container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Background

RayPDF was originally built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. As the project grew, it was migrated to a modern stack for better maintainability and scalability:

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and an improved developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid and consistent UI development.

> **Note:** Some parts of the codebase still use legacy structures from the original implementation. Contributors should expect gradual updates as testing and refactoring continue.
